# Sample Test Cases 
The control wire is used to communicate the angle. The angle is determined by the duration of a pulse that is applied to the control wire. This is called Pulse Coded Modulation.
By changing the potâ€™s NOP position, servo motor will change its angle.


| pulse     |   expected   output     | passed or Not |
| ---       |       ---      |   ---   |
| Motor turned to 90 degree |neutral position | passed |
| Pulse is <1.5 ms |  Shaft turns closer to 0 degrees | passed |
| Pulse is >1.5 ms | Shaft turns closer to 180 Degrees | passed |
